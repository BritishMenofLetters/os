Lab 1: Linux Processes
1. Open ssh client (e.g. putty.exe) and connect to your host
• host ip address: A: 161.53.167.74, B: 161.53.167.95
• username: ubuntu
• password: oposum22oposum

2. Find process id (PID) and parent process id (PPID) of your console

• type ps -f [enter]
• Console (bash) process id is ________
• How many processes are listed?
________
• What is the parent (PPID) process of your “ps -f” process?
_______________________________________________

3. Start an endless loop process to run in background as follows:

• type while :; do :; done & [enter]

4. Find the endless loop process id and parent process id

• type top [enter]
• press “f”
• using arrows scroll down to PPID
• press “space” followed by “ESC”
• endless loop process is the one with highest %CPU consumption
• PID: ______
• PPID: ______

5. Find cpu affinity mask of the running endless loop process

• type taskset -p [PID] [enter]
• cpu affinity mask is _______

6. Find last used cpu by the running endless loop process

• type top [enter]
• press “f”
• using arrows scroll down to p
• press “space” followed by “escape”
• For 1 minute, observe the p printout for the endless loop process and write used cpus
_______________________

7. Set endless loop process to run only on 1
st and 3rd cpu

• type taskset 5 -p 5 [PID] [enter]

8. Repeat step 6

• Observe the p printout for the endless loop process and write used cpus
_______________________

9. Set endless loop process to run only on 3rd cpu

• write the used command
_____________________

10. Start another endless loop process to run in background

• check PID, PPID and cpu mask of the new endless loop process
• PID: ______
• PPID: ______
• cpu mask: ____

11. Kill the second endless loop process

• type kill -9 [PID] [enter]

12. Check the process is no longer running

13. Move the first endless loop process to run in foreground

• type jobs [enter] and find the job id
• type fg [job_id] [enter]
• press “CTRL+c” to stop the process

14. Find the “the "parent of all processes” process

• start the endless loop process to run in background
• find the endless loop process [PID] and [PPID]
• type ps -fp [PPID]
• repeat previous step for each [PPID]
• write the [PID] of the "parent of all processes” process
_______
• end the endless loop process
